# Mars Android application
***

## Overview

This application is the first version of what will eventually be an easy to use application for patients in a small to medium doctor's office. The most important features have been implemented such as login, appointment search and messaging.

Please read through the code to get a feeling of how the application works. I explained all classes and functions that were created specifically for the app. For any other information such as the functions onDestroy(), onStart(), and how Activities work, please read the Android Developer site.

I have included some screenshots on the images folder on the root of the project to get a look of how the application looks and works.

## Things completed

- Robust messaging app, enabling staff and patient to communicate effectively eliminating number of calls received in the office.

- Online appointment search for current, available appointments.

- User login that checks if you are registered with the office and has logout capability.

## Things to do

- Change the package name of application to reflect application's website. (For now it is: com.example.egonzalezh94.testproject)

- Combine updateStart() and updateEnd() into one function on AppointmentFragment.java

- Have all requests to server be through POST request instead of sending information through url for security purposes.

- Have all available appointments printed dynamically with a button that will allow to "book" appointment.

- Make distinction between regular and premium user.

- Implement EMR onto application

## Extra features

- Forgot password action

- Call office with a push of a button.
